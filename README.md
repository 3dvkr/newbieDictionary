# newbieDictionary
**I want to make this Open Source (definition in the dictionary!) to enable us all to add and learn from each other!** 


I have been thinking about making this for some time, but I wanted to make sure that I had enough knowledge about random tech words before I started... 

 

A code/tech dictionary! 

 

Sometimes, (well for me at least) it very much seems that this industry has overcomplicated words and phrases for things _on purpose._ 

You may be learning from someone who has been in the industry for a while, and for them, these words _just make sense_ 

But do they make sense to you, as a newbie? 

Absolutely not 

I have tried to gather a few words/phrases and definitions together here to help you out, and we can add to it as we go along!! 

There are sometimes multiple words for the same thing, again - just to be confusing. I’ve tried to include all definitions that I’ve heard, but please let me know if I’ve missed any!
