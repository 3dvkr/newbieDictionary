**I wanted to make this Open Source (definition in the dictionary!) to enable us all to add and learn from each other!
I want YOU to contribute. Click 'fork repository' (button in the top right), make your additions in your 'own version', and then create a pull request (definition below) to put it back into this main version! I'll review it and then add it in** üòÑ


I have been thinking about making this for some time, but I wanted to make sure that I had enough knowledge about random tech words before I started... 

 

A code/tech dictionary! 

 

Sometimes, (well for me at least) it very much seems that this industry has overcomplicated words and phrases for things _on purpose._ 

You may be learning from someone who has been in the industry for a while, and for them, these words _just make sense_ 

But do they make sense to you, as a newbie? 

Absolutely not 

I have tried to gather a few words/phrases and definitions together here to help you out, and we can add to it as we go along!! 

There are sometimes multiple words for the same thing, again - just to be confusing. I‚Äôve tried to include all definitions that I‚Äôve heard, but please let me know if I‚Äôve missed any!
                                                                             üìñ

#### API - 
Stands for Application Programming Interface, which provides a comprehensive layer of communication and callbacks to the original software layer, so that it becomes easier to integrate. Example- The google maps API allows you to integrate their maps to your apps through their API.

#### ASCII - 
Stands for 'American Standard Code for Information Interchange'. It is the set of common characters use in electronic communication, based in English alphabet, numbers, punctuation symbols and non-printing control characters (like Escape, Tabulation, Backspace, End of Line, etc). This standard is the base line to newer sets of characters like UTF-8 standard, that extends ASCII including new characters like Latin or German characters by example.
                                                           
#### Boilerplate (code) - 
The standard code you need to put into your code in order for it to run. An example is frameworks. Let‚Äôs take Bootstrap as an example. To use it, you need to copy and paste in a bunch of code that you get from the official website in order for you to be able to use it. Like a template.

#### Callback function - 

A function (Plug-in) passed as an argument to another function or method (Worker). The function Worker call the function Plug-in within its context with the corresponding data, e.i.:

```javascript

// Notify functions are our Plug-ins

function notifyByAlert(msg) {
  alert(msg)
}

function notifyByConsole(msg) {
  console.log(msg)
}

function notifyBySweetAlert(msg) {
  Swal.fire({
    icon: 'info',
    title: msg
  })
}

// This function is our Worker
function greetings(name, callback)  {
  let message = `Hello ${name}`
  callback(message)
}

// Here we'll inject our Plug-in functions, in other words, a callback

greetings('Test #1', notifyByAlert)
greetings('Test #2', notifyByConsole)
greetings('Test #3', notifyBySweetAlert) // this one require sweet alert 2 lib


```

#### CLI - 

See [Terminal or Cli](#terminal-or-cli--)

#### Directory - 
Another word for folder. 
_‚ÄùNavigate to the correct directory‚Äù_ = go to the right folder.  
 
#### The DOM - 
Stands for Document Object Model. Always in capitals like that. A place in the browser to see a page‚Äôs HTML, CSS, and JavaScript all working together like a happy little family. You can type in it and add stuff. Useful when making a website and you want something to look a particular way. 

See [Manipulating the DOM](#manipulating-the-dom--)

#### Destructuring - 
This means to unpack values in a data structure such as an Object or Array.  

#### Environment - 
Where you are working within your computer. For example, if you are making a webpage, your environment would be a **text editor** or **IDE** and the browser window. 

#### Framework - 
A platform for developing software applications. It has rules, instructions and some boundations which makes it different from a library. Since they are often built, tested, and optimized by several experienced software engineers and programmers, software frameworks are versatile, robust, and efficient. It is a language written to help you to write code easier. Often comes with **boilerplate** code to get you started.

#### Function -  
The block of code that you can call by name, a function is independent of an object.

#### Function & variable naming conventions - 
A naming convention is a set of rules for choosing the character sequence to be used for identifiers which denote variables, types, functions, and other entities in source code and documentation.
 - Camel Case: Writing names without spaces or punctuation, indicating the separation of words with a single capitalized letter.
    Example:
     - helloWorld
     - newbieDictionary
 - Pascal Case: Making the first letter of each word capitalized. Often used when writing code to name functions, classes, and other objects.
    Example:
     - Car
     - LinkedList
 - kabab-case: Putting a hyphen between words in order to improve readability while allowing them to be used as variables in code.
    Example:
     - hello-world
     - active-multiplier
 - snake_case: Putting an underscore between words to improve readability, and for languages where a hyphen would be interpreted as a subtract operation
    Example:
     - hello_world
     - python_rocks
 - SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE: snake_case but louder (all caps), often used to easily distinguish macros and constants from variables
    Example:
     - HELLO_WORLD
     - HOST_NAME

#### **Git** -

#### **JSON** - 
Stands for JavaScript Object Notation. JSON is a common data format (a way data is written), originally derived from JavaScript, many programming languages now have the ability to use JSON. JSON data types include: number, string, boolean, array, object, or null. Basic JSON might look like this:

``var person = {firstName:"Faye", lastName:"Sipiano", age:27, eyeColor:"blue"};``

#### **Responsive Web Design** - 
The practice of designing websites so that they adapt gracefully to different-sized devices like phones, tablets, wearable devices, etc. If you‚Äôre able to visit a website on your phone and it looks just as proportional and seamless as it does on your computer, it‚Äôs an example of responsive web design.
  
#### **Source Code** - 
Any collection of code that is displayed in a human readable format. Source code can be sent to a compiler to be translated into machine code for the CPU to utilize. 

#### **SPA** -

#### **Technical debt** - 
Extra development work that arises when code that is easy to implement in the short run is used instead of applying the best overall solution. If you keep implementing short term solutions, you'll soon be paying a lot of interest (Time, money) when adding new features because the codebase will be a mess.

#### **Text editor** - 
Somewhere that you can write code. Microsoft Word is a text editor. Notepad is a text editor. It is pretty much just somewhere that you can hit the keyboard and stuff appears...
